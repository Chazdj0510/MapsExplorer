# Maps Explorer Android App

## Overview

**Maps Explorer** is an Android application built to fulfill a Material Design-focused assignment. It integrates Google Maps with interactive UI elements, allowing users to explore, add, and manage locations visually on a map and in a list. The app uses key Material Design components to provide a modern and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Google Maps Fragment:** Displays a map centered on a default location with several landmark markers (e.g., Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty).
- **Add Location Floating Action Button:** Users can search for locations by name or address using Google Places Autocomplete and add them as markers on the map and items in the list.
- **Bottom Navigation View:** Allows switching between three main screens:
  - **Map View:** Shows the Google Map with location markers.
  - **List View:** Displays added locations in a scrollable CardView-based list.
  - **Settings:** Provides preferences such as toggling Dark Mode.
- **Toolbar:** Displays app title and menu, including a link to the Settings screen.
- **Theme Support:** Light (baby blue) and Dark (dark blue) mode themes with appropriate color adjustments for text and UI elements.

## Material Design Elements Used

- **Toolbar** at the top for app title and menu options.
- **Floating Action Button (FAB)** to add new locations interactively.
- **RecyclerView / CardView** for an elegant scrollable list of locations.
- **Bottom Navigation View** for smooth navigation across main sections.
- **Google Maps Fragment** to embed interactive maps with markers.

## Design Decisions & Challenges

- **Google Places Autocomplete** was used for intuitive location search and address-to-coordinate conversion, improving UX over manual input.
- Theme colors were customized to match the desired baby blue and dark blue palettes, requiring careful color resource management and night mode support.
- Managing state and dynamic UI updates when locations are added, ensuring markers appear both on the map and in the list without data inconsistency.
- Handling the Floating Action Buttonâ€™s positioning to avoid obstructing map controls such as zoom buttons.
- Ensuring toolbar titles and menu options update contextually when navigating between fragments.
- Implementing persistent dark mode setting with SharedPreferences, applied at app launch and dynamically during runtime.
